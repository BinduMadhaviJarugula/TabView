# TabView :blush:
This is the application which tells us about tab view using fragments.
It contains three tab views.
First fragment consists of button which displays a simple Toast message :raised_hands: 
And second and third fragments contains thier simple text.
This application mainly uses fragments concept to implement tab view.
This is the basic application which understands easily for starters :blush::thumbsup:
